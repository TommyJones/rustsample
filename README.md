The `rustsample` package has a simple alias sampler built in Rust. It's my attempt at an R package wrapping Rust code. I have no plans to publish to CRAN. This package is for my own education, using the [extendr_api](crate), made by the extendr project, below. 

Some projects that are worth following if you're interested in R and Rust are:

* [r-rust](https://github.com/r-rust)
* [extendr](https://github.com/extendr)
